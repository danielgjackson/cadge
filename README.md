# CaDGe - *.CDG file parser, terminal player, lyric recognizer, and converter to timed .LRC files*

*CD+Graphics* (CD+G) is an extension to audio CDs that adds a low resolution graphical layer, with the information embedded in otherwise unused bits of the data stream.  This has typically been used for Karaoke music to embed the lyrics as a low-resolution image of the rendered text.

This project contains a library that decodes the data stream (from .CDG files already separated from the music) into images over time.  These can optionally be shown as an animated render at the terminal.  

Additional layers try to understand when lines of lyrics are added, when progress is made to show them as *sung*, and to recognize the text of the lyrics and extract them to a [timed text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timed_text) format: [.LRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LRC_(file_format)).


## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the required dependencies installed:

* Ensure `tesseract` is installed, and the binary is in your `PATH`: [github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-tesseract)

* Ensure `node` is installed, and on your `PATH`: [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

* Ensure you have a copy of the contents of this repository, e.g. [download the .zip](https://github.com/danielgjackson/cadge/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract all of the files to a directory.

* Ensure you are at a terminal/command prompt, and the current directory is the one containing the files in the root of this repository.


## Usage: Lyric Extraction

To try to recognize the lyrics from the graphical `.cdg` file, and save the timed lyrics to an `.lrc` file, run (where `$FILENAME` is the name of your file):

```bash
node src/main.mjs $FILENAME.cdg > $FILENAME.lrc
```


## Usage: Playback in Terminal

To *play* a `.cdg` file in your terminal window, zoom out to ensure your terminal is at least 300x108 characters in size (add `--rate 1` option to change the playback speed):

```bash
node src/main.mjs --term $FILENAME.cdg
```


## Notes on Lyric Analysis

Rough design for lyric analysis:

* [x] Track last clear index as the background index.

* [x] On clear and palette change, flag colour indices as "background" colour (luminance similarity to the last cleared index), and determine which indices are equivalent to one another (almost identical colours).

* [x] On row changes (tile writes and clear):
  * Record the total number of foreground pixels, and the min and max of any foreground pixels.
  * Count the number of pixel changes: "del": foreground to background, "add": background to foreground, "change": foreground to another (non-equivalent) foreground colour. For each category, remember the minimum and maximum X value for the change.

* [x] Calculate current row groups:
  * Each row with non-zero foreground pixels is a group.
  * Dilate (e.g. 1-3 pixels) either side to expand the rows
  * Adjacent rows are part of the same group
  * Find overlapping groups from the previous frame and assign as the same.
  * Previous groups that no longer exist, or now have more than one matching current group (split) are treated as "removed" (and any current groups unmatched) - removing a group puts it into the "removed" state to force a transition out of any current state, before being deleted.
  * Unmatched groups are treated as new, "added" groups

* [x] Each group tracks its current state with start/end timestamps for each state enter/leave, and horizontal positions for when the state changed, and the time of the last relevant operation for that state: "writing" for any "add" operations, "erasing" for any "del" operations, "progress" for any "change" operations. To help lyric analysis: each group's min/max rows are recorded, and the total number of clear operations performed before the group was created.

* [x] On group exit from "writing" state, the rows are captured in monochrome as background/non-background, and the min/max foreground X positions calculated. If the minimum width/height is too small, or (optionally) if the span does not cover the centre line, the group is ignored. OCR is performed on the text, and the horizontal start/end of each word is recorded.

* [x] On entering, updates to, and exit from, the "progress" state: the horizontal progress is increased monotonically and timestamps tracked between each word (exiting gives a timestamp for the final word).

* [x] On stream end, any existing groups are "removed", and lyric analysis can be performed.
  * Detect initial lead-in/progress markers (e.g. '>'/'Â»' or similar to '|||||') and mark as a progress element.
  * Possibly: detect instructions (e.g. in parentheses, or initial "M:"/"F:"/"D:") and treat appropriately.
  * Lyrics are analysed to decide which rows could be merged (previous line recent, placed above, and no ending punctuation; and current line doesn't begin with a capital letter), or split (at ending punctuation).

* [x] Heuristics to ignore non-lyric graphical screens.

* [x] Lyrics output e.g. in an .LRC file format.

* CD+EG Extended Graphics, from: https://extended.graphics/#tech
  * Adds an extra video buffer, doubling the video memory
  * This can be used for full 8 bit (256 color) graphics, or the two buffers can be used for independent 4 bit (16 color) images. 
  * When used independently, one buffer can written while the other is displaying, then they can be instantly switched. 
  * There is also a mode that allows the two buffers to be blended together, this can produce a dissolve effect, or one layer can be scrolled on a stationary background.
  * "Line graphics mode"?
